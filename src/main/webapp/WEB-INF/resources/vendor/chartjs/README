Version 2.5 brings some exciting new features to Chart.js. Now, configuration options can be updated at runtime (with some exceptions) just by changing the chart.config.options object and calling chart.update().

More powerful plugins that can be added to an individual chart (instead of globally), but also disabled on a per chart basis. This gives you fine grained control over when plugins interact with your charts. The plugins were changed to support cancelling actions by returning false from any before* plugin calls.

Two new extensions have been added: beforeEvent and afterEvent, respectively called before and after the chart responds to an input event such as a mousemove or a click. The plugin is passed a wrapped version of the event, that implements IEvent.
